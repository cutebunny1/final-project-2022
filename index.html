      Hi! My name is Kripa and I'm a student at the <a href = "http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>! For a class project, I was tasked with creating a website and I decided to make it about food. Food has always been very special and personal to me, so I hope to share some inspiration of potential meals and desserts with you all. 
    </p>

			Something that has always intrigued me is how few vegetarians and vegans there are. I have been vegetarian all my life, so it was not a shift of lifestyle for me. However, it is for a lot of people. I realize part of the barrier to entry to becoming vegetarian is figuring out what to eat. So, I have compiled a list of vegetarian food ideas -- split up by meals and dessert. Hope this helps people meal prep and inspires more people to choose being vegetarian!

      <img src = "images/lychee.jpeg" width = 700 alt = "Lychee plant"/> 
    </div>

			Through this website, I hope to show you there is more to being vegetarian than only eating salads, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Though, fresh fruits and vegetables are certainly healthy. I am personally a huge fan of lychees, as you can see on the website icon and in the image above.
